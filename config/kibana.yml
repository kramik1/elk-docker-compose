# Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.

# To allow connections from remote users, set this parameter to a non-loopback address.

# Enables you to specify a path to mount Kibana at if you are running behind a proxy.
# Use the `server.rewriteBasePath` setting to tell Kibana if it should remove the basePath
# from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup.
# This setting cannot end in a slash.
server.basePath: /kibana-proxy

# Specifies whether Kibana should rewrite requests that are prefixed with
# `server.basePath` or require that they are rewritten by your reverse proxy.
# This setting was effectively always `false` before Kibana 6.3 and will
# default to `true` starting in Kibana 7.0.

# If your Elasticsearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide
